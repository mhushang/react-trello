# Hi there, this project was done in a very limited time so don't be hard on it ha-ha

In this project implemented the Trello board in pure react, no third-party libraries were used, only what was generated by:
```
yarn create react-app _app_name --template typescript
```
WOW :)

Here I have tried to implement MVC pattern for the components, in order to write tests only for logic (controller), without mixing the view. Also I have tried to typeб best as I couldб all the application state (useContext, useReducer).

In this video you can see how the app works: https://www.loom.com/share/1853fd61ddcd453cbbda43f07b331f74

So how to start the project:

- You can type 
```
docker-compose up
```
and everything will be started in dev mode,
or just run 
```
yarn start
```


Thanks. Cheers.
