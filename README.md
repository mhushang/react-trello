# Hi there, this project was done in a very limited time so don't be hard on it ha-ha

In this project implemented the Trello board in pure react, no third-party libraries were used, only what was generated by:
```
yarn create react-app _app_name --template typescript
```
WOW :)

Here I have tried to implement MVC pattern for the components, in order to write tests only for logic (controller), without mixing the view. Also I have tried to type, best as I could, all the application state (useContext, useReducer).

In this video you can see how the app works:

So, how to start the project:

You can type 
```
docker-compose up
```
and everything will be started in dev mode,
or just run 
```
yarn start
```

Definitely we should add next features and refactorings to release app in production:

- Configure environment for testing, staging and production;
- Implement Authorization;
- Implement all necessary pages, like settings, profile;
- Need to use some css framework (tailwind css more preferable);
- Need to use css preprocessor (scss/sass preferable);
- Work on optimization (in several places we need to memoize components);
- Cover with tests;
- Need to refactor types;
- Use prettier and pre-commit to format code before pushing it;


Thanks. Cheers.
